## TODO
- data from the hive (cassandra) is gone after cluster restart. Bad config for pv and pvc? After pods recreate (pvc and pv was intact) organizations in thehive was erased. Sooo not so much improvement afterall. Maybe add thehive and ES to pvc will help?
- nginx
- ES as index
- thehive require time to initiated. cassandra must by up and running first
